# Todo Test AWS Jenkins 🚀

**DevOps Learning Project - CI/CD Pipeline with AWS & Jenkins**

## 📋 Project Overview

This project demonstrates my exploration into **DevOps practices** by building a Todo application with a complete **CI/CD pipeline** using **Jenkins** and **AWS cloud infrastructure**. It showcases modern deployment practices, automated testing, and cloud-native development workflows.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

**DevOps & Cloud Engineering Skills**
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated build, test, and deployment workflow
- **AWS Cloud Services**: Infrastructure deployment and management
- **Jenkins Automation**: Build automation and continuous integration
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Automated cloud resource provisioning

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

### Application
- **Frontend**: React.js/JavaScript - Simple Todo interface
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express or Python/Django - REST API
- **Database**: AWS RDS or DynamoDB - Cloud database solution

### DevOps Infrastructure
- **Jenkins** - CI/CD automation server
- **AWS EC2** - Application hosting and compute
- **AWS S3** - Static asset storage and build artifacts
- **AWS RDS/DynamoDB** - Managed database services
- **Docker** - Containerization (if applicable)
- **Git/GitHub** - Version control and webhooks

## 🏗️ CI/CD Pipeline Architecture

    Git Webhooks           Build & Test              EC2 Deployment
    Code Changes           Automated Tests           Load Balancing
    Pull Requests          Quality Gates             Auto Scaling
```

## 🔄 Pipeline Stages

### 1. **Source Control**
- ✅ Git webhooks trigger builds on code changes
- ✅ Branch-based deployment strategies
- ✅ Pull request validation workflows

### 2. **Build & Test**
- ✅ Automated dependency installation
- ✅ Unit and integration test execution
- ✅ Code quality checks and linting
- ✅ Build artifact generation

### 3. **Deploy to AWS**
- ✅ Automated deployment to EC2 instances
- ✅ Database migration and seeding
- ✅ Environment configuration management
- ✅ Health checks and rollback capabilities

## ☁️ AWS Services Integration

### Compute & Storage
- **EC2 Instances** - Application hosting environment
- **S3 Buckets** - Static assets and build artifacts storage
- **ELB** - Load balancing for high availability (if configured)

### Database & Networking
- **RDS/DynamoDB** - Managed database services
- **VPC** - Network isolation and security
- **Security Groups** - Firewall rules and access control

### Monitoring & Logging
- **CloudWatch** - Application and infrastructure monitoring
- **CloudTrail** - API call auditing and compliance
- **SNS** - Notification services for pipeline alerts

## 🧪 Testing & Quality Assurance

### Automated Testing
- **Unit Tests** - Component-level validation
- **Integration Tests** - API and database connectivity
- **End-to-End Tests** - Complete user workflow validation
- **Performance Tests** - Load and stress testing

### Quality Gates
- **Code Coverage** - Minimum test coverage requirements
- **Security Scanning** - Vulnerability assessment
- **Dependency Checking** - Outdated package detection

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- AWS Account with appropriate permissions
- Jenkins server (local or cloud-hosted)
- Node.js/Python development environment
- Git and GitHub account

### Local Development
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/luis12007/Todo_test_aws_jenkins.git
cd Todo_test_aws_jenkins

# Install dependencies
npm install  # or pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run locally
npm start    # or python manage.py runserver
```

### Jenkins Pipeline Setup
1. **Configure AWS Credentials** in Jenkins
2. **Install Required Plugins** (AWS, Git, Node.js/Python)
3. **Create Pipeline Job** with GitHub webhook
4. **Configure Build Steps** for test and deployment
5. **Set Up AWS Infrastructure** using Jenkins automation

## 📊 DevOps Achievements
